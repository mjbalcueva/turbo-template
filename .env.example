# Since .env is gitignored, you can use .env.example to build a new .env file when you clone the repo.
# Keep this file up-to-date when you add new variables to \.env\.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any secrets in it.
# If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named .env and populate it with your secrets.

# NOTE: Environment variables are now split into package-specific .env files:
# - packages/db/.env - Database connection
# - apps/backend/.env - Backend server configuration
# - apps/web/.env.local - Web app configuration (Next.js)
# - apps/mobile/.env - Mobile app configuration

# The database URL is used to connect to your Supabase database.
